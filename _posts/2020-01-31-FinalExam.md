# python section:

I couldn't solve the python questions because of the stress on the exam and when I saw that I couldn't solve the first question, my stress increased.When I was solving questions,I realized I didn't know how to use class in python and when I learned it better I was able to solve the question 7,8 and 9.

- The first question was about finding the length of a string.

- The second question wanted to copy a string to empty string.

- The third question wanted to get the number of repeats of a letter in a string.wich I solve it with a simple loop.

- The seventh question was to define a class called a Student that would get an ID or name as parameter and changes the name and ID of the struct to the new value.

- Question Eight receives a pointer to the student struct from the input and returns a string into student number, ":" and name.
