The project, titled Working Hours, records the hours of arrival and departure of employees.
The idea for this project was raised by my brother and with the help of Dr. Etemadi and Mr. Rahimi I made it.

As can be seen, the name and time of arrival and departure are recorded.

The "Search" option can also search for names.
