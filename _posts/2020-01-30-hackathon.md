The project, titled [Working Hours](http://98521162.pythonanywhere.com/), records the hours of arrival and departure of employees.
The idea for this project was raised by my brother and with the help of Dr. Etemadi and Mr. Rahimi I made it.

In this section, enter the name of the person and the time of arrival and departure.

As can be seen, the name and time of arrival and departure are recorded.

use "add another one" option to return to the previous page and enter another name.
The "Search" option can also search for names.

I introduced this program in mass presentation.
